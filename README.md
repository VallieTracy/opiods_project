<h2>Data Analytics and Visulization Project Two</h2>
<h3> Unites States Opioid Epidemic, 2000-2018<h3>

Our project visualizes data from the Center from Disease Control detailing opioid deaths and prescription opioid sales per 100,000 in all 50 states. In our interactive dashboard users can interact with our dataset and see the trends by state and by year. We also have created an API route so future students and researches can make use of this dataset. Our site is powered by Flask, created using Python. We used Bootstrap as the main structure of our website and we used the D3, Leaflet, and Amcharts JavaScript libraries to make the graphs and user interactions. Our webiste is hosted by Heroku.
