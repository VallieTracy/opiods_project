# Opioid Prescription Sales and Deaths Dashboard
### Unites States Opioid Epidemic, 2000-2018

Our project visualizes data from the Center from Disease Control detailing opioid deaths and prescription opioid sales per 100,000 in all 50 states. In our interactive dashboard users can interact with our dataset and see the trends by state and by year. We also have created an API route so future students and researches can make use of this dataset.  The completed project and links for the APIs are hosted on Heroku and can be viewed [here.](https://opioids-data-visualization.herokuapp.com/)
